HP may communicate with you by e-mail. You agree that all such notices, disclosures and other communications that HP provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

You agree that all of your User Submissions are non-confidential and non-proprietary, and HP does not guarantee that you will have any recourse through HP or any third party to edit or delete any User Submission you have submitted.\n\nBy submitting any User Submission, you represent and warrant that:\n\n\ta.\tYou own all rights in your User Submissions (including, without limitation, all rights to the audio, video, or digital recording and the performance contained in your User Submissions) or, alternatively, you have acquired all necessary rights in your User Submissions to enable you to grant to HP the rights in your User Submissions as described in these Terms;\n\n\tb.\tYou have paid and will pay in full all license fees, clearance fees, and other financial obligations, of any kind, arising from any use or commercial exploitation of your User Submissions;\n\n\tc.\tYou are the individual pictured and/or heard in your User Submissions or, alternatively, you have obtained permission from each person (including consent from parents or guardians for any individual under the age of eighteen (18)) who appears and/or is heard in your User Submissions to grant the rights to HP as described in these Terms;\n\n\td.\tYou voluntarily agree to waive all \"moral rights\" that you may have in your User Submission;\n\n\te.\tAny information contained in your User Submission is not known by you to be false, inaccurate, or misleading;\n\n\tf.\tYour User Submission does not incorporate materials from a third party web site, or addresses, email addresses, contact information, or phone numbers (other than your own); and\n\n\tg.\tYour User Submission does not contain or constitute any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of solicitation.\n\nBy submitting a User Submission, you grant to HP an irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, worldwide, royalty-free license (sub-licensable through multiple tiers) to: use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, or display your User Submissions (or any modification thereto), in whole or in part, for the purpose of providing you with the Service and related support.\n\n\t6.\tMonitoring and Enforcement\n\nWhile not obligated to perform investigations, HP may:\n\n\ta.\tInvestigate violations or misuse of this Service;\n\n\tb.\tInvestigate and help prevent security threats, fraud, or other illegal, malicious, or inappropriate activity;\n\n\tc.\tRemove, disable access to, or modify any content or resource that HP believes violates these Terms or any other agreement HP has with you; or\n\n\td.\tSuspend or terminate the provision of Services to you for uses that violate these Terms or any other agreement HP has with you.\n\nIt is up to HP to decide whether any User Submission or use of the Service by you is prohibited. All User Submissions to HP or actions performed while using this Service, whether provided or performed by yourself or someone else are your sole responsibility.\n\nHP may report any activity that it suspects violates any law or regulation to appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other appropriate third parties. HP's reporting may include disclosing appropriate information that you may have provided. HP also may cooperate with appropriate law enforcement agencies, regulators, or other appropriate third parties to help with the investigation and prosecution of illegal conduct by providing network and systems information related to alleged violations of these Terms.\n\n\t7.\tLinks to Third-Party Websites and Applications\n\nAs part of this Service, HP has provided links and access to third-party websites and social media applications. HP neither controls nor is responsible for any of the third-party websites or applications (or the products, services, or content available on or through any of those websites or applications). Thus, HP does not endorse or make any representations about such third-party websites or applications, or any information, software, products, services, or materials found there or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites or applications linked from the Application, you do so entirely at your own risk and you shall be deemed subject to the privacy policies and terms and conditions for those third-party websites and applications. These Terms are not applicable to your use of any such third-party websites or applications.\n\n\t8.\tDisclaimers of Warranty\n\nTHE SERVICE, APPLICATION, AND MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"WITH ALL FAULTS\" AND THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE, APPLICATION, AND MATERIALS IS WITH YOU.\n\nHP EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND (EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY) WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE, APPLICATION, AND MATERIALS, WHICH INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\n\nTHIS MEANS THAT HP DOES NOT PROMISE YOU THAT THE SERVICE IS FREE OF PROBLEMS. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, HP makes no warranty that the Service will meet your requirements or that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error free or that defects in the tools will be corrected. HP makes no warranty as to the results that may be obtained from the use of the Service or as to the accuracy or reliability of any information obtained through the use of the Service. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you through the Service, Application or Materials, or from HP or other affiliated companies, or its or their suppliers (or the respective officers, directors, employees, or agents of any such entities) (collectively, “HP Parties\") shall create any warranty. HP disclaims all equitable indemnities.\n\n\t9.\tLimitation of Liability and Remedies\n\nBY USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT THE HP PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, APPLICATION, OR MATERIALS. To the fullest extent permitted by law, HP will have no obligation or liability (whether arising in contract, warranty, tort, negligence, product liability or otherwise) for any incidental, indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages or liabilities (including lost profits, loss of income, revenue goodwill, reputation or savings, loss or unavailability of or damage to data or software restoration), even if advised of the possibility of such damages or liabilities.\n\n\t10.\tIndemnification\n\nYou agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless HP from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that third parties may incur as a result of or arising from your (or anyone using your device’s) violation of these Terms in connection with the use of the Service. HP reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with HP’s defense of such claim.\n\n\t11.\tExclusions and Limitations\n\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages. Accordingly, some of the above disclaimers and limitations of liability may not apply to you. To the extent that any HP Party may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of the HP Party's liability shall be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.\n\n\t12.\tOther Agreements\n\nHP may provide products (such as hardware or software) and services (such as software subscription services, hardware maintenance or repair or software maintenance, installation, or training) under the terms of a separate agreement between you and HP, such as a license agreement or separate terms of sale and warranty terms (each, an \"Other Agreement\"). HP's obligations regarding any product or service access that it makes available to you under any Other Agreement shall be governed solely by the Other Agreement under which such product or service is provided and these Terms shall not be deemed or construed to alter the terms of any such Other Agreement. If there is an inconsistency between these Terms and any Other Agreement, the Other Agreement will control.\n\n\t13.\tThe Service is void where prohibited or restricted by law.\n\n\t14.\tGoverning Law\n\nThese Terms shall be construed under, and governed by, the laws of the State of California, United States of America, without regard to its choice of law principals.\n\n\t15.\tMiscellaneous\n\nThe failure of HP to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions of HP and you as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Service. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by HP without restriction.\n\n\t16.\tEntire Agreement\n\nThese Terms constitute the entire understanding between you and HP relating to the Service and will supersede any previous communication, representation, or agreement, whether oral or written.\n"; ObjectID = "TEb-3v-7vp";</note>
